  The benefit of using a structure is to have a simplified group of variables associated to its structure. In the program the 
differenciation between PlayerInfo and GameInfo was a easier indication in what variables should I assign and use at a given point in 
the program. Hence, on this line `if(gInfo.maxMoves < pInfo.numLives || gInfo.maxMoves > (int)(gInfo.pathLength * .75))` it was easier
to identify the variables that would help in the comparison.

2.
  In order to achieve this we can create a new structure called GameHistory wherein we can add the list appropriate values of the results in the
it where we can store the user, result, lives, and all significant details. We can make use of parallel arrays in order to get matching values
per key.

3.
  The part where I spent most time working on is the computations and outputs for location, treause, lives and number of moves.
In order to overcome this I created a pseudocode to run through the possible values that are allowed and how would it affect the 
entire program.
