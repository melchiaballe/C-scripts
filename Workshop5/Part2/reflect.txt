1. 2 selection constructs: switch, and if statements. 
Switch:
  switch (inputMonth)
  {
    case 11:
        printf("NOV-");
        break;
    case 12:
        printf("DEC-");
        break;
  }
If statement:
  If(inputMonth == 11) {
    printf("NOV-");
  } else if (inputMonth == 12){
    printf("DEC-");
  }


2.
  3 types of iteration constructs: while, do while, and for. I used a while loop since the validation is not bound by a number but
it is dependent on a specified condition and will continue until the desired output is placed.


3.
  For debugging the program what I did was separate code blocks into different segment in order to identify a certain problem per block.
Afterwards on the calculations side I used the Trial and Error method to identify the proper computations of each problem.
