1.
Given the ReportData structure that has 3 integer and 7 double variables the total number or minimum bytes would be 62 which is 6 for integer and 56 for double.
In order to make the passing of information be improved in the example of `displayReportData` function, we can do a pass by reference or passing the addresses of
the variables to the function.

2.
In order to improve the ReportData structure and reduce redundancy with the CatFoodInfo structure we can do it this way.
struct ReportData
{
    struct CatFoodInfo cFoodInfo;
    double weightInKg;
    int grams;
    double totalServing;
    double totalCostPerServing;
    double costPerServing;
    double costCalPerServing;
};
With this structure we are now calling the CatFoodInfo structure inside the ReportData. Then in the displayReportData we can alter it by changing the data
to this `rData.cFoodInfo.SKU, rData.cFoodInfo.price, rData.cFoodInfo.weightInPounds, rData.weightInKg, rData.grams, rData.cFoodInfo.calPerServing, 
rData.totalServing, rData.costPerServing, rData.costCalPerServing`
