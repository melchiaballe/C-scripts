1.
In order to accomplish linking of related data in a parallel array. First I declared
similar arrays with different types to contain different value then I used the loop index
as the key so that all data are in sync.


2.
Based on what I know the array starts with 0 since int declaration usually starts with 0
as seen on the code "i = 0" which indicates the first item on the array. Also, 0 is part of
an integer where as in natural number it starts with 1.

An array is like a grouping cars, we can group them by small cars, big cars, and trucks. Afterwards
we will line them up per group hence this is their sequence or positions. We would then count from the first one
as starting with 0 until the last. In order to access a certain vehicle we have to first choose the group then
we can select what position do we need to get.
